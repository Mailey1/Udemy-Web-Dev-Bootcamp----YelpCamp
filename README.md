# Udemy-Web-Dev-Bootcamp----YelpCamp

Small campsite app, that allows user to post a campsite with a title, picture, pirce, and description. Also allows users to leave comments of campground pages.
Hosted on Heroku here: https://serene-ocean-81375.herokuapp.com/

Made to practice all the materials covered in the Udemy Web Dev Bootcamp. Uses MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, along with using RESTful routing. Uses mongoose to use the database, and passport to handle authorization and authentication.

Hoping to add an admin user, so that more campgrounds can easily be created to help populate the campgrounds page, and delete content in miniscule chance anyone posts garbage.
